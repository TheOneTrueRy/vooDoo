Who Do You VooDoo?
=====================

My lovely partner wanted me to make a clicker game like my old Moon Miner project when I first started coding, but with a customizable voodoo doll. I then couldn't pry her away from her tablet drawing all kinds of accessory variations on a little doll guy for hours. That sparked two weeks of developing this game together! Her having input on the style and game logic and drawing lots of custom art, as I did all the coding :)
